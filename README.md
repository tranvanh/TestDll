# TestDll

Solution is ready to run with no additional settings. 
If modifications to ModelDll were made, make sure all these are set:
* After building ModelDLL, .dll,.lib, including CTest.h files must be move to `includes/CTest` for TestDLL to run correctly.
* TestDLL must be set as a startup project.
